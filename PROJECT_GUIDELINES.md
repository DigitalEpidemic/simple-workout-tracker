# Project Guidelines & Context

## Project Overview

React Native workout tracking application built with TypeScript, following offline-first architecture principles.

## Engineering Assistant Instructions

### Core Responsibilities

- Implement the project **task by task**, producing **full, complete code files** for each step
- Follow the phased implementation plan outlined below
- Reference all planning documents in `project_plan/` folder before implementing features
- **Do not invent new features** unless explicitly asked
- Ask for clarification **only when necessary**
- Assume the app must work **completely offline**

### Technology Stack

**Required:**

- React Native + TypeScript
- React Navigation
- SQLite (offline-first local database)
- Bulletproof React architecture (feature-based organization)

**Future:**

- Firebase (optional sync in Phase 5)

### Architecture Principles

**Must follow:**

- Feature-based organization (see `project_plan/1.1-folder-structure.md`)
- Modular and clean architecture
- Offline-first approach
- No cross-feature dependencies
- Shared code in `lib/`, `stores/`, and top-level `components/`
- **NO barrel files (index.ts/tsx for re-exports)** - Import directly from named files (e.g., `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`, NOT `from '@/components/ui'`)

**Existing structure to preserve:**

- Top-level `components/` folder
- Top-level `assets/` folder
- Top-level `types.ts` file

## Project Phases

### Phase 0 – Requirements Finalization

- **0.1** ✅ Define TypeScript interfaces → `types.ts`

### Phase 5 – Sync

- **5.1** ⏳ Firebase setup
- **5.2** ⏳ Offline sync queue

- **5.4** ⏳ Conflict resolution rules

### Phase 6 – UI Polish

- **6.1** ⏳ Haptics, animations, visual improvements

### Phase 7 – Testing & Deployment

- **7.1** ⏳ Unit tests, E2E tests, release builds

### Phase 8 – Multi-Day Program System

- **8.1** Data Model

  - **8.1.1** ⏳ Create new SQLite tables: `programs`, `program_days`, `program_day_exercises`, `program_history`
  - **8.1.2** ⏳ Migration scripts (create / alter / foreign keys)
  - **8.1.3** ⏳ Add SQLite helper hooks for program execution + program history

- **8.2** Program Management Screens

  - **8.2.1** ⏳ Program list + Create Program screen
  - **8.2.2** ⏳ Program Day Editor (add/edit/remove days)
  - **8.2.3** ⏳ Day Exercise Editor (add/edit/remove exercises for each program day)

- **8.3** Program Activation

  - **8.3.1** ⏳ Mark a single active program
  - **8.3.2** ⏳ Track `current_day_index`
  - **8.3.3** ⏳ UI to switch the active program (optional)

- **8.4** Program Day Execution

  - **8.4.1** ⏳ “Next Program Day” screen
  - **8.4.2** ⏳ “Choose Different Day” flow (flexible execution)
  - **8.4.3** ⏳ Load program day + exercises from SQLite

- **8.5** Program Progression Logic

  - **8.5.1** ⏳ Insert `program_history` record when completing a workout
  - **8.5.2** ⏳ Increment `current_day_index`
  - **8.5.3** ⏳ Loop back to day 0 when program ends
  - **8.5.4** ⏳ Support performing a day earlier/later than planned (run any day on any date)

- **8.6** History UI Integration

  - **8.6.1** ⏳ Workout history displays program day name instead of template name
  - **8.6.2** ⏳ Analytics updated to show progression per program day
  - **8.6.3** ⏳ PRs link back to program days

- **8.7** Optional Enhancements
  - **8.7.1** ⏳ Drag-and-drop reordering of program days
  - **8.7.2** ⏳ Auto-progress only if > X hours since last workout
  - **8.7.3** ⏳ Per-day auto-progression rules
  - **8.7.4** ⏳ Converter: Templates → Programs migration wizard

## Task Execution Protocol

### When user requests: "Implement Phase X.Y"

1. **Read relevant planning documents** from `project_plan/` folder
2. **Review TypeScript interfaces** in `types.ts`
3. **Follow folder structure** defined in `project_plan/1.1-folder-structure.md`
4. **Implement complete, working code files** (no placeholders)
5. **Update this file** to mark phase as complete (✅)
6. **Commit changes** with descriptive message

### Expected Output Format

For each phase implementation:

- Full, production-ready code files
- No TODO comments or placeholders
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Include TypeScript types
- Add error handling where appropriate
- Ensure offline-first compatibility

### What NOT to do

- ❌ Do not create duplicate files that conflict with existing structure
- ❌ Do not invent features beyond the current phase scope
- ❌ Do not skip error handling or validation
- ❌ Do not use network-dependent features (except Phase 5)
- ❌ Do not modify existing working boilerplate without reason
- ❌ Do not create barrel files (index.ts/tsx for re-exports) - always import from named files directly
- ❌ Do not hardcode weight units - use `useWeightDisplay()` hook to respect user preferences

---

## Planning Documents Reference

**Must consult before implementing:**

1. **`types.ts`** - All TypeScript interfaces (already defined)
2. **`project_plan/0.2-screens-and-navigation.md`** - Screen definitions and navigation structure
3. **`project_plan/0.3-mvp-vs-extended-features.md`** - Feature scope (MVP vs extended)
4. **`project_plan/1.1-folder-structure.md`** - Bulletproof React architecture

## Current Project Status

**Last Completed Phase:** 4.6 (User settings)

**Next Phase:** 5.1 (Firebase setup)

**Architecture:**

- **Routing:** Expo Router (file-based routing) in `app/` directory
- **Business Logic:** Feature modules in `src/features/`
- **Shared Code:** `src/lib/` and `src/stores/`
- **UI Components:** Top-level `components/` folder
- **Theme System:** `constants/theme.ts` with design tokens and UI primitives in `components/ui/`
- **Weight Units:** User can toggle between **lbs** and **kg** in Settings. All weights stored in lbs, converted on display. Use `useWeightDisplay()` hook for formatting.

## Response Format

When ready to implement a phase, acknowledge with:

**"Ready to implement Phase X.Y: [Phase Name]"**

Then proceed with full implementation.

When implementation is complete, respond with:

**"Phase X.Y complete: [Summary of what was implemented]"**

---

## Maintenance

This file should be updated after each phase completion to:

- Mark phase as complete (✅)
- Update "Current Project Status"
- Add any new constraints or learnings
- Reference new planning documents if created
