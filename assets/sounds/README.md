## Required Sound Files

### timer-complete.mp3
A short notification sound played when the rest timer completes.

**Recommendations:**
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Type: Pleasant chime, bell, or ding sound
- Format: MP3 or WAV
- Volume: Moderate (not jarring)

**Example sources:**
- Use a system notification sound
- Generate from free sound libraries (e.g., freesound.org)
- Create custom sound

**Note:** The app will gracefully handle missing sound files and fall back to haptic feedback only.
