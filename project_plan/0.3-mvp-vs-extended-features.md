## Decision: What to Build First

### Phases 1-4 Focus (MVP)
Build a **complete, polished core experience** without analytics or sync.

User can track workouts effectively, use templates, reference previous workouts, and maintain a complete history—all offline.

### Defer to Later Phases
- Charts and analytics (Phase 6)
- PR tracking and celebrations (Phase 6)
- Calendar view (Phase 6)
- Firebase sync (Phase 5)
- Social features (Phase 7+)

This approach ensures:
- Fast time to working product
- Solid foundation before adding complexity
- User can track workouts immediately
- Lower risk of scope creep
- Easier testing and iteration
